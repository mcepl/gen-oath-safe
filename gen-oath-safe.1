.B gen\-oath\-safe
[\fIOPTION\fR] [\fIISSUER:\fR]\fIUSERNAME\fR[\fI@DOMAIN\fR] [\fITOKENTYPE\fR] [\fISECRET\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create OTP configurations for linOPT, mod_authn_otp, and Yubikey.
The configurations and qrcode are output to stdout.
If a Yubikey inserted prior to running, and Yubikey binaries are installed, 
this program attempts to write the configuration directly to the Yubikey.
